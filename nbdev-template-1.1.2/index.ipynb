    "## FEWSNET API Notebooks Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the FEWSNET API Notebooks Repository!\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "designed to serve as a practical resource for understanding\n",
    "and executing API calls. Our notebooks provide hands-on\n",
    "examples, required libraries and tutorials that guide you through\n",
    "various data queries and manipulations using APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "`Comprehensive Guides:` Step-by-step notebooks on how to\n",
    "interact with different public APIs, complete with detailed explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ready-to-Use Code:` Snippets that are fully executable and can\n",
    "be easily adapted for various data analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Resource-Rich Documentation:` Markdown cells within notebooks\n",
    "offer rich documentation and context for each step of the API interaction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Community-Driven:` Opportunities for the community to contribute and\n",
    "enhance the repository with new examples and improved methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository/download the notebook to your local machine.\n",
    "2. Create a virtual environment and Install the necessary dependencies\n",
    "listed in the requirements.txt file. (Each project folder has a requirements.txt\n",
    "file that lists the libraries used).\n",
    "3. Open the directory on Jupyter/Jupyterlab\n",
    "4. Explore the notebooks directory to find examples relevant to\n",
    "your needs and Follow the instructions within each notebook to run the code cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Set-up guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clone the entire repository using HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to the main page of the repository. In this case\n",
    "[here](https://github.com/FEWS-NET/data-notebook-hub)\n",
    "- click on the `Code` button and copy the url under HTTPS.\n",
    "- Open a terminal window and navigate to your desired directory.\n",
    "- On the terminal use the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "This will clone the repository to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "PS. {desired_local_repo_name}\n",
    "is optional you can use a desired name or leave it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Creating a virtual environment and installing requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a virtual environment, navigate to the directory where the virtual environment\n",
    "will be created and on the terminal, enter the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "python -m venv env_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "replace env_name with a preferred name for your virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next activate the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "source 'path-to-env'/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the virtual environment is activated, install the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "pip install -r 'path-to-project-root-directory' requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Open the Notebook/Notebooks directory on Jupyter (Jupyterlab)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the terminal, with the  virtual environment activated. Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "jupyter lab \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will instantiate a local server at port 8888 and open a tab on\n",
    "your browser where you can explore the notebooks and run them.\n",
    "Alternatively, you can open them on Jupyter rathr than jupyter lab. to do this, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also open a local server at localhost:8888 and open a new tab on your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "if the tab does not open automatically, check the output on the terminal and\n",
    "copy the provided url and open it on your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Libraries\n",
